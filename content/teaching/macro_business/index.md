Welcome! This course intends to give a deep theoretical but also practical knowledge in applied macroeconomics. Strong emphasis is placed on students solving "case studies" where they are given assignments that should be solved in groups of 2-3 students. The working method where 2-3 students jointly solve assignments are thought to stimulate discussion and create a deeper understanding of macroeconomic problem formulation and problem-solving. The practical assignments consist largely of data collection, data processing, calculation and analysis of results and oral and written presentation.

Important parts of the course include:
  * How the different components of the macroeconomics stick together
  * Exchange rates, deflation, inflation and prices
  * Focus on empirical macroeconomics
  * Technical development, innovation, competitiveness and growth
  * Monetary and fiscal policy
  * Financial markets, labour and product market
  * Compile, analyse and report on macroeconomic data, verbally and in writing
