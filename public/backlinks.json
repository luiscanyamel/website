In this course we will study the economy of Latin America. The main purpose of this class is to advance your understanding on the economic development of the region, as well as of the challenges that will shape the region‚Äôs future. To this end, we will learn about a variety of topics, including economic history, economic growth, trade policy, fiscal and monetary policy, and other economic phenomena of special interest for Latin American countries. From time to time, we will have the opportunity to zoom in into country-specific historical episodes.\nIntroductory video Here‚Äôs an excellent introduction to the topic by Professor (UPenn). Please watch before our first class meeting. To skip the introduction, fast forward to minute 4.\nIntroductory Podcast Here‚Äôs a fantastic podcast by discussing the Political Economy of Latin America. The podcast touches upon the region‚Äôs experimentation with democratization and the growing threats of authoritarism.

We show that if society can control the extent to which economic agents are exposed to the virus and agents can commit to contracts, virus externalities are local, and competitive equilibria are efficient. The Second Welfare Theorem also holds. These results still apply when infection status is imperfectly observed and when agents are privately informed about their infection status. If society cannot control virus exposure, then virus externalities are global and competitive equilibria are inefficient, but the policy implications are very different from those in the literature. Economic activity in this version of our model can be inefficiently low, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that viruses create global externalities and result in inefficiently high economic activity. If agents cannot commit, competitive equilibria are inefficient because of a novel pecuniary externality.","tags":["Macroeconomics","Public Economics","Pandemics","Externalities"],"title":"On the Efficiency of Competitive Equilibria with Pandemics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Garcia-Vazquez","Luis Perez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660521600,"objectID":"e414d6b691fe1ba2ce2a63ce64efe7e4","permalink":"http://localhost:4118/publication/gvp_2022/","publishdate":"2022-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gvp_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Health is typically imperfectly measured. How important is this imperfect ob- servability to evaluate the costs of bad health? We estimate a dynamic, structural life-cycle model of savings and labor supply with health risk under two assump- tions on the observability of health. The first one, which is prevalent in much of the literature, is that health is perfectly observable. The second one is that, while health is not observable, a battery of noisy measures of health is available to the researcher. We find that ignoring measurement error in health leads to substan- tially underestimating both the persistence of health and the time costs of being unhealthy. Ultimately, measurement error has an effect on the estimated lifetime costs of bad health‚Äîas measured by labor earnings, hours worked, consumption, and assets‚Äîleading to underestimate these by as much as 300%. A key message of our paper is that estimating the lifetime costs of bad health using structural economic models requires researchers to worry about measurement error in health.","tags":["Health","Measurement Error","Structural Models","Econometrics"],"title":"The Impact of Measurement in Health on Health-Related Counterfactuals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["V.V.

The aim of the course is to give students both broad and deep knowledge of the facts and the theories of economic growth. A special emphasis is placed on the relationship between technological development and economic growth.\nThe course starts with presenting facts about economic growth and then the four main growth paradigms are introduced: the neoclassical model, the Romer product variety model, the Schumpeterian model, and the AK model.\nThe study of economic growth requires highly theoretical models in order to understand how different factors affect the development of the economy and a large part of the course is devoted to develop students‚Äô ability to use mathematics in solving these models. Group work and seminars are essential parts of the course, where students develop good working skills in using relevant mathematical tools for analyzing economic growth and designing policies.\nCourse Materials Here you can find syllabus, slides, and homeworks.

Strong emphasis is placed on students solving ‚Äúcase studies‚Äù where they are given assignments that should be solved in groups of 2-3 students. The working method where 2-3 students jointly solve assignments are thought to stimulate discussion and create a deeper understanding of macroeconomic problem formulation and problem-solving. The practical assignments consist largely of data collection, data processing, calculation and analysis of results and oral and written presentation.\nImportant parts of the course include:\nHow the different components of the macroeconomics stick together Exchange rates, deflation, inflation and prices Focus on empirical macroeconomics Technical development, innovation, competitiveness and growth Monetary and fiscal policy Financial markets, labour and product market Compile, analyse and report on macroeconomic data, verbally and in writing Course Materials Here you can find syllabus, slides, and homeworks.
